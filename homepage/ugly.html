					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>
						My name is Jiachen Xu. I am studying Computer Science in University of Alberta to become a software developer.
						Currently I am also working as a teaching assistant for an introduction course for Python in the university.
						My favourite things are: compatitive video games, eating ramen, rock climbing and making plans that turns out to be useless!

					<h2>What can I offer</h2>
					<p>
						"I've always had a knack for solving problems and I feel that software does just that. I chose a career in software development because I find satisfaction in helping consumers, companies, and organizations find the solutions they need—from creating spreadsheets to designing skyscrapers. Additionally, I have experience with a variety of programming languages and enjoy working with them. For example, I helped a client build a business website and web app. I also built human resources software at my prior job"
